\textit{HP ProBook Hewlett Packard laptop with a Intel(R)
Core(TM) i7-4900MQ} processor (4 cores with 2 threads)
with a configured core frequency of 3.20 GHz, 16 GB
RAM, and 256 GB SSD.

At the same time, parallel execution of a small number
of operations over sc-memory (for example, 100 or
10,000 operations) in some cases can be worse than their
sequential execution (Table 2).
This behavior is related to the peculiarities of the con-trol mechanisms of the processes in the shared semantic
memory, the classes of operations to be performed, and
their specified input values in the context of the problem
to be solved. For example, all sc-construction search oper-ations with the same sc-elements, executed in parallel, do
not block each other. For example, the speed of parallel
execution of operations on ostis-system files depends
on the size of the buffer used when reading external
information constructions and writing them to disk, as
well as on the length of the information constructions
themselves.

Network access to sc-memory is provided by the
server subsystem of the ostis-systems software platform,
implemented on the basis of Websocket and JSON
languages (protocols) and providing network operations
(commands) over sc-memory [3].
In the process of testing the implementation, the
throughput of its commands was calculated. During the
load testing a test client system implemented in C++ was
used. The same device was used as the device used for
testing operations over sc-memory. As a result, it was
found out that when sending 1000 different commands:
\textit{or creating sc-elements, commands for pro-cessing contents of ostis-system files} and \textit{commands for
deleting sc-elements} — the time spent on their processing
did not exceed 0.2 seconds. At the same time, in some
cases it took no more than 0.14 seconds to process 1000 \textit{commands for creating sc-elements}
, while for commands \textit{commands
for deleting sc-elements}
 it took no more than 0.12
seconds, commands for processing the contents of ostis-system files — no more than 0.10 seconds, commands
to search for sc-constructions isomorphic to a given five-element graph-template — no more than 0.45 seconds.

From the test results, it is clear that the current
implementation of the ostis-systems software platform is
an effective means of processing distributed information
using both the software interface and the network inter-face and communication protocols.

The proposed shared semantic memory model enables
efficient tracking and synchronization of parallel data
accesses. The implementation of this model demonstrates
a significant increase (by 2-3 orders of magnitude) in
the throughput of parallel task execution compared to
previous versions of the platform. However, to ensure
(causal, sequential) consistency of processes and their
operations, besides the data level, it is necessary to
manage the knowledge level [37] .

shared semantic memory has been proposed and dis-cussed in detail, including (!):

is consistent with the previously described ontological
model of this memory [3]. The author of this paper
believes that the used approach to modeling of complex
objects will help to simplify the understanding of the
operation of intelligent systems developed according to
the principles of the OSTIS Technology
